# Bird Speak

> Birds speak many languages. I speak mostly one.

A simple bookmarklet for  [twitter.com](http://www.twitter.com/) that translates tweets to your language.


## Install & usage

Add the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar and click it when viewing  [twitter.com](http://www.twitter.com/) to translate tweets
to your language. 

The language tweets get translated to is based on the html attribute "lang" in the current document. This is set in your Settings/Account/Language preference. English and Japanese are currenty the only languages that are available.

You can find a link to the bookmarklet [here](http://softprops.github.com/bird-speak) 

## TODO
 * make a bit more generic
 * figure out a how to support other languages
 * host js from a gist while returning the proper content type
